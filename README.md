# SyncFolder
<b> SyncFolder is a git like file synchronization program.</b>
<br/><br/>
It's very simple to use, just start the program on the two machines <br/>
you have a folder you want to synchronize and either manually fetch,<br/> 
download the files and then commit the changes to the folder or let <br/>
the program do it automatically.<br/>
<br/>
The SyncFolder dll can be used (and modified) to <br/>
send files from one computer to the other with <br/>
guaranteed file integrity (not corruption).<br/>
